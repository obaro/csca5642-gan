## Introduction
This project is an attempt to transform images from a given set (photo_jpg) to resemble images from another set (monet_jpg).
This is the Kaggle [I'm Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/gan-getting-started/) competition.
We'll be using a GAN to tackle this challenge.

The dataset contains a folder of images in the style of Monet, called monet_jpg, and the task is to convert the images in the photos_jpg folder into this same style. The challenge allows adding more images than those existing in the photos_jpg, but we will be sticking with the existing images.
